{"name":"Airplane","tagline":"Computer graphics mini project. [Game]","body":"# Computer Graphics Project \r\n============================\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe goal of this game is to fly as far as possible, with only two controls at your\r\ndisposal, this is one of those “easy to learn, difficult to master” situations. You’ll first\r\nselect a plane and a scene. Click once to start make your little guy take off from an\r\nairport, and it’s on!!\r\n\r\nAs you fly, right click to begin ascending; the plane descends automatically. So it’s\r\ncritical to master this bouncy method of flying.<br/>\r\nMissiles of varying sizes are shot at you. So, you’ll spend most of your time avoiding\r\nthese. Keep a close eye at the fuel gauge! You’ll steadily be running out of fuel as you\r\ntry to gain height. Hit a missile, run out of fuel, or fly into the bottom edge of the\r\nscreen, and you’ll crash and burn!\r\n\r\nAs far as the game interface is concerned, you’ll be greeted with a loading screen\r\nfollowed by a splash screen with the name of the developers (that’s Arpith and Anil!).\r\nYou’ll then see a menu with screen with the following items:<br/>\r\n• Play<br/>\r\n• Settings<br/>\r\n• Instructions<br/>\r\n• Credits<br/>\r\n• High Scores<br/>\r\n• Exit<br/>\r\n\r\nThe user can either start the game directly, if he knows how the game works or has\r\nplayed it before, by clicking in the box with “Play” option. Otherwise, he can view the\r\ninstruction as to the game works by clicking on the “Instruction” button. If the player\r\nhas changed his mind to play the game sometime later, he can click on “Exit” button\r\nwhich terminates the game.\r\n\r\nWhen the player hits on the Instruction button, another page which describes how the\r\ngame works appears. Similarly, credits page will show you the name of the\r\ndevelopers. Setting page will allow you to choose the plane and environment scene of\r\nyour wish. Pressing escape at any point of time will bring you to the main page.\r\n\r\nThis easy to play game can be further developed to include new features. You may\r\nunlock new planes as you progress through the game. Each plane may have its own\r\nability from getting invisible or using time warp to a powerful explosive power.\r\nPlayers may left click on the screen to initiate a power-up.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\nImplemented using C++ and OpenGL.<br/>\r\nSOIL libraries have been used to load images.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-44764219-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
